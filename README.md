While asking for resources for a deep dive into Epic Game's Unreal Engine architecture beyond the little information provided in the official documentation, to my dismay someone responded there aren't many resources like that around. So begins my journey to understand the engine, write notes on my findings, and share it.

Although there may not be many resources on unraveling the engine code, there are a plethora of resources that help in understanding the engine. [Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6709076-game-engine-architecture) is a great resource on understanding Unreal Engine, and game engines in general.
